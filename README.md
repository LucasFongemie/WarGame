# War Card Game

This project is a coded version of the card game war.

It is written in Java in an Eclipse workspace.

The code uses 4 different classes that create a deck of cards, shuffle them out and compare them to one another until there is a winner.

# Project Status

This project currently plays a war game between a player and a computer where you hit enter after each round to play the next.

I want to further this project by adding card names and suits, along with possibly computer vs computer or 2 players.
